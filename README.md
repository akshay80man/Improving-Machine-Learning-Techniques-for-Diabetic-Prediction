# Improving-Machine-Learning-Techniques-for-Diabetic-Prediction
This study aims to predict Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus in individuals using ML techniques. Used various classification and ensemble methods, such as KNN, random forest, logistic regression, and SVM, to achieve high accuracy in diabetes detection. Our system can help in early diagnosis of diabetes and prevent its complications.
